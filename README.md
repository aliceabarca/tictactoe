### Wins + Challenges:

- A big win was creating functions initially had unintended side effects in terms of the data model that got affected. We resolved this by striving for pure functions where applicable and isolating the functions. This avoided any unwanted changes to our global variables. 

- A challenge was aming my variables and functions was a challenge at first, but I conciously decided what the function or variable was doing and kept the naming consistent accordingly.
